# 🐍 Python OOP Assignments

This project contains two beginner-friendly assignments to practice **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python.  

---

## 📌 Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class
- Created a **Superhero** class with attributes (name, power, strength) and methods.  
- Added **inheritance** by creating a **Villain** class that extends the Superhero class.  
- Practiced **constructors (`__init__`)**, **method overriding (polymorphism)**, and object creation.  

### Example:
```python
hero1 = Superhero("Iron Man", "Tech Genius", 85)
villain1 = Villain("Thanos", "Infinity Stones", 120, "Destroy half the universe")

hero1.introduce()
villain1.introduce()
